This repository will eventually contain all common sorting and search algorithms created in JavaScript. I hope it will be useful for any web developer that did not start their career as a CS student.

To get started:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the repository in your favorite terminal app
3. ```yarn install``` or ```npm install```

You can run tests using mocha with ```yarn test``` or ```npm test```

Tests can be found in the test directory and algorithms can be found in the search directory.
